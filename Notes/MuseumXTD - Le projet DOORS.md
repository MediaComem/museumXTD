## DOORS: Digital Incubator for Museums

[DOORS: Digital Incubator for Museums](https://ars.electronica.art/doors/en/) was developed by Ars Electronica, MUSEUM BOOSTER and Ecsite within the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The programme focuses specifically on small and medium-scale institutions.
 
DOORS' approach is not focused on the technology itself, but on the underlying strategies, transformation processes and value propositions required for a digital transformation, as well as the shared benefits of working with creative & technology partners. The digital needs to be gradually built into the DNA of museums as opposed to isolating these endeavours and investments. We deem capability to be essential in the uncertain times, which is why the programme also focuses on:
- creating conversations that challenge mind-sets and connect people to each other
- fuelling collaboration and innovation - thriving in the expected and the unexpected
- unleashing innovation – creating new connections and paradigms
- investing in partnerships
- continually improving and evolving how museums do every day stuff         
DOORS team has developed a framework and methodology to help museums advance their digital confidence. Designing the Incubation Programme as a process driven by shared learnings, allowed us to pursue innovation that would not occur under individualistic/hermetic experimentation or business-as-usual circumstances. We prioritise collaboration over competition and encourage museum professionals to seek out their peers for camaraderie, advice and collaboration so that they can move forward as effective collaborators.
