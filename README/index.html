<p>The applied research pilot project <strong>MuseumXTD</strong> (&quot;museum extended&quot;) explores the challenges of the digital transition within small and medium-sized museums.</p>
<h4 id="Adding-new-content-with-MarkDown-files" tabindex="-1">Adding new content with MarkDown files</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>title</strong> This property is referenced in the <em><strong>layouts/base.njk</strong></em> HTML to use as the title to the browser tab. If not set it has the default value as <em>MuseumXTD</em></li>
<li><strong>layout</strong> We add this to have your MD file contained in some HTML/CSS referenced in a njk file. For this project we have the standard HTML/CSS applied with layouts/post.njk</li>
<li><strong>date</strong> This property can be included to your front matter to override the default date (file creation) and customize how the file is sorted in a collection. For more info on available formats see <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of the standard properties to add to your new MD file. post.njk will import the HTML from <code>base.njk</code> which imports the <code>main.css</code> styles to apply to your page.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: MuseumXTD
layout: layouts/post.njk
date: 2022-06-23
---
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to apply another layout to your MD file you can reference it's file name instead. Be sure to save your new layout file in the right folder <em>layouts</em> and have the correct syntax. Your MD file content will be rendered where you have added the following line `` on your new .njk file</p>
<h4 id="Updating-changes-to-the-live-hosting-server-on-github-pages" tabindex="-1">Updating changes to the live hosting server on github pages</h4>
<p>When you push changes to the github branch <strong>test-live</strong> which has the <strong>eleventy_build.yml</strong> file this will trigger a build of the project on github and push the created files to the <strong>docs</strong> folder. Next this folder which will contain the eleventy build, is pushed to the <strong>gh-pages</strong> branch. This branch will automatically update on the live host in a few moments.</p>
<h4 id="Configuring-Odsidian-to-automatically-push-updates-to-github" tabindex="-1">Configuring Odsidian to automatically push updates to github</h4>
<p>Open the settings tab and under <em>Community plugins</em> search for and install the plugin <strong>Obsidian Git</strong>. With this plugin you can push your changes on the project to the github repository automatically. Please read the material to understand the different options available to you.</p>
<h4 id="Running-locally" tabindex="-1">Running locally</h4>
<p>You can run the project locally by first cloning the project from github, downloading the packages <code>npm ci</code> from the package.json and then running <code>npm run start</code>. This will build the project and serve the updated docs folder on your local host to view on your browser <code>Local: http://localhost:8080</code></p>
